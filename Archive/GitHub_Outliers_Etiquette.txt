GitHub Outliers Team Etiquette

	1. Start every working session with a pull of the main branch to ensure you are up to date with any changes
	2. Include clear and concise comments when committing in case we need to reference back to an old commit 
	3. Send a message to the group slack after a merge has been completed
		a. Following a merge, each team member should complete a pull of the main branch 
	4. Most conflicts during merging occur when two team members are working on the same file 
		a. Be mindful and communicate to the group if there are two people working on the same file
		b. Once you are done working for the day, merge your branch and send a message to the team chat so others can have access to the most up to date files
