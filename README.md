# Final_Project_Outliers

### Selected Topic 
For the final project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at UC Berkeley, our team deciside to do an analysis on the impact of inflation on housing prices throughout the United States.This project will use a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices across various regions based on inflation rates.

In the last month we have a 40-year high in inflation rates. Our group is interested in understanding the impact these aggressive increases will have on housing prices across our various locations.


### Description of Data Source 
We are using multiple data source files for this project, all of which are in a CSV format. 
 * The first data file has over 3,700 rows and 150 columns, and contains information on housing prices across multiple regions in the United States. 
 	* We removed all null values and limited the dataset to a nine year period between 2011 - 2020. 
 * The second dataset has over 1,310 rows and 2 columns, and contains information on the consumer price index between 1913 to 2022.
 	* We removed unnecessary years in this dataset in order to align to the housing prices dataset. 
 
We will utilize data from Zillow's research arm to access data associated with home prices from 2011 to the present. In addition to this very robust dataset, we will be using data from the St. Louis Fed associated with the consumer price index. We are including links to the original [housing price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/zillow-house-price-data?select=Sale_Prices_City.csv) and the [consumer price index dataset](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS).  
 
By combining these datasets together, we will create one comprehensive view that can be used for the remainder of this analysis.

### Project Question
The question we are trying to answer in this project is can we create an algorithm that uses inflation rates to predict housing prices in individual regions across the United States? 


### Communication Protocols 
Below you can see a list of our team's communication protocols. 

 * All meeting times we will be set assuming PST time zone
 * Primary communication method is group slack chat
 * Backup communication method is group text messages
 * All team members commit to meet from 7pm to 9pm on Tuesday and Thursday until the project is complete
 * The team will set up additional meetings as needed during the week and on the weekend as needed 
 * Every time someone merges a branch in GitHub a message will be sent to the group slack so everyone has visibility 
 * Refer to GitHub best practices document for additional guidance to ensure consistency on GitHub use
