# Final Project Outliers

### Project Overview
This project will use a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices across various regions based on inflation rates.

In the last month we have a 40-year high in inflation rates. Our group is interested in understanding the impact these aggressive increases will have on housing prices across our various locations.

### Project Question
Can we predict housing prices across various regions in the United States using consumer price index, fuel rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, mortgage data, and other variables through a machine learning model? 

### Description of Data Source 
 * [Unemployment Rates](https://data.oecd.org/unemp/unemployment-rate.htm) - Rates for the United States, filtered between 2011 to 2022. 
 * [Housing Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/zillow-house-price-data?select=Sale_Prices_City.csv) - Contains information on housing prices across multiple regions in the United States. 
 * [Gas Prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMD_EPD2D_PTE_R50_DPG&f=W)
 * [Consumer Price Index Dataset](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS) - Contains information on the consumer price index between 1913 to 2022.
 * [Mortgage Data](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/National-Mortgage-Database-Aggregate-Data.aspx) - Monthly mortgage data in the United States on a monthly basis. 

We will combine these datasets together to create one comprehensive view that can be used for the remainder of this analysis.

### Machine Learning Model 

### Database

### Dashboard 
Tableau will be used to create an interactive dashboard to help visualize the relationship between housing prices and our variables.  Our dashboard will contain a filter that allows users to limit the data by date and region. The story board will include a United State map visual that indicates region housing prices through a heatmap or bubble size, a data table that lists the housing prices and associated variables across different regions and line charts that show trending of the variables over time. 

### Communication Protocols 
Below you can see a list of our team's communication protocols. 

 * All meeting times we will be set assuming PST time zone
 * Primary communication method is group slack chat
 * Backup communication method is group text messages
 * All team members commit to meet from 7pm to 9pm on Tuesday and Thursday until the project is complete
 * The team will set up additional meetings as needed during the week and on the weekend as needed 
 * Every time someone merges a branch in GitHub a message will be sent to the group slack so everyone has visibility 
 * Refer to GitHub best practices document for additional guidance to ensure consistency on GitHub use
